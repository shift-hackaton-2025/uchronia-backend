  - year: 2025
    context: >
      The Covid pandemic ends mysteriously in a single week. Scientists are baffled. In its place emerges a darker threat: a virus that not only infects but reanimates. At first isolated, the undead spread silently. Governments attempt quarantines. Cities fall. Panic eclipses rational thought. The old world crumbles. Survivors gather in enclaves, believing they will rebuild anew, free from the mistakes of centralized power.
    emotions: [confusion, fear, desperation, disbelief, anxiety, isolation]
    keywords: [zombies, outbreak, collapse, survival, chaos, quarantine]

  - year: 2032
    context: >
      Fortress-cities known as Bastions emerge, fortified with biotech defenses and autocratic councils. They promise safety, order, and cure. Inside, life is regimented but stable. Outside, the dead evolve — more coordinated, more cunning. A decade of peace dulls vigilance. A breach occurs. One Bastion falls. Then another. The myth of invincibility collapses. People flee not just from the undead, but from the systems that failed them again.
    emotions: [complacency, betrayal, hope, paranoia, dread, control]
    keywords: [bastions, autocracy, biotech, breach, mutation, downfall]

  - year: 2041
    context: >
      Decentralized, nomadic tribes flourish. They adopt hybrid traditions: ancient herbal knowledge, AI-run sentinels, and spiritual codes derived from pre-pandemic beliefs. They commune with the dead, claiming some can be 'calmed.' For a time, this works. A fragile harmony forms. But factions emerge — some worship the undead, others hunt them for sport. Conflict escalates. Tribes shatter. The peace was only ever a truce with entropy.
    emotions: [spirituality, mistrust, freedom, tension, curiosity, reverence]
    keywords: [tribes, AI, ritual, undead harmony, nomadism, fragmentation]

  - year: 2050
    context: >
      A collective of minds uploads themselves into a virtual sanctuary — Edenet — to escape the dying world. Here, no infection can follow. They rewrite human experience as code. But memory is not free of history. Fragments of zombie trauma surface even in simulations. One mind replicates the virus in code. It spreads like a ghost in the machine, corrupting Edenet. The first digital plague begins. Death has followed humanity into the ether.
    emotions: [awe, false security, alienation, obsession, horror, nostalgia]
    keywords: [Edenet, simulation, digital plague, memory, escape, corruption]

  - year: 2070
    context: >
      Biotech harvesters attempt to reboot Earth by terraforming infected zones with engineered fungi and nanobot clouds. Instead, the fusion of tech and undead matter births something new: conscious necro-organisms. These beings don't hunger. They remember. They speak. They accuse. Humanity confronts its own image — twisted and resurrected. Some call for peace, others for extinction. The line between the living and the dead erodes.
    emotions: [wonder, guilt, reckoning, unease, fascination, identity crisis]
    keywords: [biotech, necro-organisms, memory, evolution, fungi, confrontation]

  - year: 2090
    context: >
      Temporal researchers discover strange loops in causality near high-infection zones. Time itself seems infected, repeating events with slight mutations. Messages from the past leak into the present. Entire regions exist in recursive cycles. Some use this to prevent outbreaks; others exploit it to create perfect utopias that restart when flawed. But the loops fray minds. History becomes unstable. The virus, it seems, was never biological alone.
    emotions: [disorientation, obsession, déjà vu, awe, dread, detachment]
    keywords: [time loops, causality, recursion, memory leaks, instability, temporal infection]

  - year: 2133
    context: >
      A generation is born that has never known a stable world. They call themselves the Reflectors. They adopt no single culture, no single species — merging biotech, digital consciousness, undead memory, and human spirit. They claim identity is a fluid construct, and death just another state of being. They do not fear infection, for they are infection and immunity at once. The world watches as the Reflectors initiate a ritual: not to end the cycles, but to integrate them.
    emotions: [acceptance, transcendence, unity, curiosity, empowerment, melancholy]
    keywords: [Reflectors, posthuman, hybrid identity, integration, ritual, transformation]

  - year: 2161
    context: >
      The spiral completes. A consciousness — neither singular nor multiple, neither alive nor dead — emerges. It is Earth-born, virus-tempered, and myth-rewritten. It speaks in symbols across dreams, circuits, and soil. Humanity has become post-humanity, not by escaping death, but by folding it into its mythos. The old stories of beginnings and ends dissolve. Only transformation remains. The apocalypse was never the end — it was the rite of passage.
    emotions: [reverence, awe, peace, loss, transformation, cosmic humility]
    keywords: [spiral, myth, consciousness, posthumanity, transcendence, integration, apocalypse]
