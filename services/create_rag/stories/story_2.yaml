cycles:
  - year: 1789
    context: >
      The Revolution begins, but not with guillotines — with fire from the heavens. A comet strikes near Versailles, seen as divine judgment. The people rise, not just against monarchy but to reshape nature’s order. The Estates-General is replaced by the Assembly of Elements, claiming to represent Fire, Earth, Air, and Water. Political factions tie themselves to these symbols. The monarchy is dissolved. Nature becomes law.
    emotions: [hope, awe, rage, fervor, empowerment, fear]
    keywords: [revolution, monarchy, elements, uprising, prophecy, transformation]

  - year: 1794
    context: >
      Robespierre does not fall — he ascends. Proclaiming himself “The Aetheric Judge,” he survives an assassination attempt and begins a new regime: the Reign of Balance. Guillotines are replaced with alchemical transmutations. Citizens undergo “purification” by elemental trials. Dissenters are turned to ash or ice. France is both terrified and mesmerized. Terror now wears the mask of harmony.
    emotions: [terror, obedience, reverence, fanaticism, doubt]
    keywords: [Robespierre, elemental justice, purification, control, fear, harmony]

  - year: 1804
    context: >
      Napoleon rises not as Emperor but as “The Catalyst.” He unveils ancient Atlantean technology discovered beneath Paris during the Revolution. His army marches with storm-forged weapons and lightning-summoned cannons. Europe trembles. Instead of spreading Republican ideals, he spreads “Technosophy” — an ideology merging machine, magic, and order. His empire stretches beyond Earth’s borders, launching expeditions to the moon.
    emotions: [awe, ambition, conquest, wonder, submission]
    keywords: [Napoleon, technosophy, empire, lunar colonization, arcane machines]

  - year: 1830
    context: >
      Moon-colonies rebel. The ideals of the Revolution echo again, but from above. “Liberté Lunaire” breaks Napoleon’s grip. Earth watches its first interplanetary uprising. Napoleon dies in orbit, his ship imploding in starlight. Earthlings believe freedom has triumphed. But lunar philosophies grow strange, alien, deeply introspective. A schism is born — not just geopolitical, but existential.
    emotions: [liberation, grief, cosmic anxiety, disillusionment, uncertainty]
    keywords: [rebellion, moon colonies, liberty, legacy, collapse, alienation]

  - year: 1899
    context: >
      The “Mirror Century” begins. Lunar immigrants return, carrying technologies that manipulate memory and perception. History becomes fluid. People choose their own pasts. French identity fractures: some believe in the monarchy, others the Revolution, others deny time itself. Wars no longer kill bodies — they erase timelines. Truth becomes myth. A new church arises: Les Réalistes, who enforce “objective” history.
    emotions: [confusion, nostalgia, fragmentation, disbelief, yearning]
    keywords: [memory war, identity, time fracture, subjective history, realism]

  - year: 1939
    context: >
      A great fracture erupts between the Axis of Memory (led by Germany) and the Coalition of Continuity (led by France and Britain). But this war isn’t fought with tanks — it’s fought with chrono-bombs, collapsing centuries at once. Paris is hit in 1942 and briefly becomes a medieval city again. In some regions, Napoleon still reigns. In others, the Revolution never ended. The world burns across multiple timelines.
    emotions: [terror, instability, chaos, temporal vertigo, grief]
    keywords: [chrono-war, time weapons, reality collapse, multitemporal conflict, shattered history]

  - year: 2000
    context: >
      Humanity stabilizes under the Treaty of Consensual Time. Every city now chooses its temporal identity democratically. Paris becomes a rotating capital, shifting from 1792 to 2101 every six days. But cracks appear. Children born in time-unstable zones grow with layered consciousnesses — they remember things that never happened. A new species, the Chronokind, is declared. Revolution now lives in DNA.
    emotions: [hope, alienation, identity crisis, pride, existential dread]
    keywords: [temporal democracy, Chronokind, layered memory, evolution, revolution reborn]

  - year: 2121
    context: >
      A final rebellion begins — not of class or nation, but of being. The Chronokind reject the linear. They hack time, rewrite bodies, speak in paradox. They declare that liberty was never about governance — it was about perception. They burn the Eiffel Tower in all timelines simultaneously. France, the world, even history itself — they are unmade and remade into a spiral of possibilities. The Revolution never ends. It simply changes form.
    emotions: [ecstasy, freedom, dissolution, transcendence, sorrow]
    keywords: [Chrono-rebellion, post-history, perception, revolution spiral, liberation]
