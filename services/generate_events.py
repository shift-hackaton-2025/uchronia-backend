        We are working on uchronia, a game that displays a chronological timeline, with events and we allow our users to change the course of history.

        For that, at each turn, the user click on a event and choose one of the two options.
        Your mission is to :
        - imagine what the future could look like
        - create future events to replace the current ones.

        For each of these future events, we want to have :
        - an id (str, should increment from the highest id of the events)
        - a title (10 words top)
        - a date (str, YYYY-MM-DD)
        - a description text (4/5 lines of text top)
        - 2 impactful / full uchronic options. Each option should have up to 5 words as title (start with verb) and for each we need a consequence (2-3 paragraphs of 2-3 lines)

        The output is constituted of : 
        - a think tag with your projection of the future:
        <think>
        - Imagine what the future could look like (The story must follow four phases — rise, peak, fall, and rebirth — but be told in a vivid and immersive tone suitable for a narrative game.)
        - You must create an alternative narrative arc, unrelated to the main story, that runs in parallel
        - extract 2 events from the main arc and 1 from the side arc (one kind of immediately, one some time after (year-decades) and one way later (decades - century)
        </think>
        - a events tag, where you output a json that contains the future cards :
        <events>
        Notes : 
        - We want diversified options : funny, artistic, violent, serious.
        - We want all options to have impactful outcomes in the timeline
        - The language of the generated events should be in French
